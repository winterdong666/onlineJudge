# Leetcode

- [Website](https://leetcode.com/)

- Started in Jan.27th

- Plan to be done in the next semester.

### Language

- Python3

### Note

- I only gave one specific solution of a problem, which maybe not the best. For some problems, if I did implement multiple solutions, I would give separated python files.

- In Leetcode solution, when we put an global variable in the outside and use `global` in the function, it may come up with WA even though it is cleared in the testbox. So the correct option is to put an `self.globalVariable` in the solution function.
